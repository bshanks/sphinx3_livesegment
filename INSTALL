In order to install this, you must first install the Sphinx dependencies. Because the version of the Sphinx stuff must be the right version, you can just download a tarball of the correct version of the Sphinx stuff from this project. As of this writing, you want sphinx-deps-0.1.1.tar.gz. Here is how to build the Sphinx libraries and download the code for and build sphinx3_livesegment:

  # if you want ALSA sound (Ubuntu needs this)
  sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev

  # download sphinx-deps-0.1.1.tar.gz from http://sourceforge.net/projects/voicekey/files/voicekey/0.1.1/sphinx-deps-0.1.1.tar.gz/download
  tar xovzf sphinx-deps-0.1.1.tar.gz
  cd sphinx-deps
  cd sphinxbase/

   make clean
  ./configure
  
  # or, if you want ALSA sound:
  ./configure --with-alsa; 
  # and make sure this doesnt fail with "configure: error: ALSA header file <alsa/asoundlib.h> not found!"

  make
  sudo make install # i'm not sure if this is necessary

  cd ../sphinx3

  # you might have to do:
  autoreconf -fvi
  make clean

  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install # i'm not sure if this is necessary
  sudo ldconfig # i'm not sure if this is necessary

  cd ..
  # for bash:
  export SPHINXBASE_PATH=`pwd`/sphinxbase
  export SPHINX3_PATH=`pwd`/sphinx3
  # hg is "mercurial", a version control system
  hg clone http://voicekey.hg.sourceforge.net:8000/hgroot/voicekey/livesegment
  cd livesegment
  make sphinx3_livesegment
